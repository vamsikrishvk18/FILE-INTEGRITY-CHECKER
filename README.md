#DESCRIPTION-The File Integrity Checker task involves a Python script designed for cybersecurity to monitor and verify the integrity of specified files or directories by detecting unauthorized changes, tampering, or corruption. Executed in Visual Studio Code, the script creates a baseline of SHA-256 cryptographic hashes for monitored files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/var/www/html`) and stores them in a `baseline.json` file, serving as a reference for the files' original state. Users can then perform integrity checks by recalculating hashes and comparing them to the baseline, identifying any discrepancies that may indicate malicious modifications or errors. The script generates three types of output: console output in the VS Code terminal, displaying an interactive menu and high-level results like “Baseline created successfully” or “Changes detected!”; a detailed log file (`file_integrity.log`) recording baseline hashes and integrity violations, such as “ERROR - Integrity violation for /var/www/html/index.html”; and the `baseline.json` file containing the reference hashes. This task supports cybersecurity monitoring by enabling users to detect potential threats, maintain system reliability, and comply with standards like PCI-DSS or HIPAA, with outputs viewable directly in VS Code for analysis and incident response.
